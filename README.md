# AUTOMATED-FOOD-IDENTIFICATION-AND-CALORIE-CALCULATION-USING-DEEP-LEARNING

Introduction:-

This project presents a novel approach for managing one’s diet by implementing an automated system that use deep learning algorithms to identify food items and calculate their calo rie content. The system utilises Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to analyse food photos, precisely identify the food type, and estimate its calorie content with precision. The main issue tackled by this project is the lack of precision and inconvenience linked to conventional approaches of calorie monitoring. These methods frequently depend on manual input of data and employ standardised nutritional values that do not consider differences in food size, preparation, and individual portions. Our solution simplifies the process of recording nutritional information by enabling users to effortlessly submit a picture of their meal, hence reducing the need for manual input and approximation. The deep-learning system analyses the picture, identifies the food components, and computes the calorie content using the determined portion size. This novel methodology not only boosts the precision of calorie quantification but also greatly promotes user adherence and involvement by streamlining the monitoring procedure. The project entails creating a comprehensive dataset with diverse food products to train the model effectively. The CNN model undergoes intensive training and validation to guarantee exceptional accuracy and dependability in real-world situations. The assessment of the model showcases its efficacy in identifying various food categories and precisely calculating calorie content, rendering it a beneficial instrument for anyone seeking to track their dietary intake, control their weight, or uphold a healthy way of living.

Modules:-

1. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN): A CNN is a deep learning algorithm which can take in an input image, assign importance (learnable weights and biases) to various aspects/objects in the image, and be able to differentiate one from the other. In your project, the CNN is likely structured to process images by applying filters that capture spatial hierarchies of features (like edges in the lower layers, and more complex shapes in the higher layers). After several layers of convolution and pooling operations, the high-level reasoning in the neural network is done via fully connected layers which interpret the features extracted by the convolutional part of the network to make the final classification and regression (for calorie estimation) decisions.
2. TensorFlow: TensorFlow is an end-to-end open-source platform for machine learning. It has a comprehensive, flexible ecosystem of tools, libraries, and community resources that lets researchers and developers build and deploy machine learning powered applications. In your project, TensorFlow provides the backend engine powering the CNN. It handles the computation of numerical operations, which includes the multi-dimensional arrays (tensors) that are processed in the neural network layers.
3. Keras: Keras is an open-source neural network library written in Python. It is capable of running on top of TensorFlow, and it was developed with a focus on enabling fast experimentation. Keras provides high-level building blocks for developing deep learning models, and it is known for its user-friendliness, modularity, and extensibility. In your project, Keras is used to define the CNN architecture, layer by layer, and it simplifies the training and evaluation of the deep learning models. It also handles the data preprocessing steps, such as loading images from directories, rescaling pixel values, and converting images into tensors that are fed into the CNN.

Result:-

The performance of our deep learning model on the test set demonstrates its durability and ability to generalise. The model had a test accuracy of roughly 95.26%, indicating its efficacy in precisely categorising food photos. The model’s exceptional precision indicates that it has effectively acquired the distinctive characteristics of different food categories and can consistently forecast the accurate classification for novel photos. The loss value observed at about 0.3423 also offers valuable information about the model’s forecasting ability. Accuracy quantifies the correctness of the model, while the loss value indicates the level of trust in its predictions. A decrease in the loss value indicates a higher level of confidence in the predictions made by our model, suggesting that it is both accurate and certain in its classifications. The performance of our Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model in categorising food photos and determining their calorie content was determined via a thorough assessment process including many epochs. The outcomes, shown in the ”Visualisation of Training Accuracy Result” and ”Visualisation of Validation Accuracy Result” graphs, provide convincing proof of the model’s proficiency.
