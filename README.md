# AUTOMATED-FOOD-IDENTIFICATION-AND-CALORIE-CALCULATION-USING-DEEP-LEARNING

Introduction:-

This project introduces an AI-driven solution for diet management using deep learning and computer vision techniques. We developed a system that employs Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to accurately identify food items from photos and estimate their calorie content using predictive analytics. Unlike traditional calorie tracking methods that rely on manual data entry and generic nutritional values, our approach automates the process with image recognition and machine learning algorithms, enhancing precision and user engagement. By training the CNN model on a diverse dataset using supervised learning, we ensure high accuracy in real-world scenarios. This tool simplifies dietary tracking, utilizing AI-powered automation to make it easier for users to monitor their intake and maintain a healthy lifestyle.

Modules:-

1. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN): A CNN is a deep learning algorithm which can take in an input image, assign importance (learnable weights and biases) to various aspects/objects in the image, and be able to differentiate one from the other. In your project, the CNN is likely structured to process images by applying filters that capture spatial hierarchies of features (like edges in the lower layers, and more complex shapes in the higher layers). After several layers of convolution and pooling operations, the high-level reasoning in the neural network is done via fully connected layers which interpret the features extracted by the convolutional part of the network to make the final classification and regression (for calorie estimation) decisions.
2. TensorFlow: TensorFlow is an end-to-end open-source platform for machine learning. It has a comprehensive, flexible ecosystem of tools, libraries, and community resources that lets researchers and developers build and deploy machine learning powered applications. In your project, TensorFlow provides the backend engine powering the CNN. It handles the computation of numerical operations, which includes the multi-dimensional arrays (tensors) that are processed in the neural network layers.
3. Keras: Keras is an open-source neural network library written in Python. It is capable of running on top of TensorFlow, and it was developed with a focus on enabling fast experimentation. Keras provides high-level building blocks for developing deep learning models, and it is known for its user-friendliness, modularity, and extensibility. In your project, Keras is used to define the CNN architecture, layer by layer, and it simplifies the training and evaluation of the deep learning models. It also handles the data preprocessing steps, such as loading images from directories, rescaling pixel values, and converting images into tensors that are fed into the CNN.

Result:-

The performance of our deep learning model on the test set demonstrates its durability and ability to generalise. The model had a test accuracy of roughly 95.26%, indicating its efficacy in precisely categorising food photos. The model’s exceptional precision indicates that it has effectively acquired the distinctive characteristics of different food categories and can consistently forecast the accurate classification for novel photos. The loss value observed at about 0.3423 also offers valuable information about the model’s forecasting ability. Accuracy quantifies the correctness of the model, while the loss value indicates the level of trust in its predictions. A decrease in the loss value indicates a higher level of confidence in the predictions made by our model, suggesting that it is both accurate and certain in its classifications. The performance of our Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model in categorising food photos and determining their calorie content was determined via a thorough assessment process including many epochs. The outcomes, shown in the ”Visualisation of Training Accuracy Result” and ”Visualisation of Validation Accuracy Result” graphs, provide convincing proof of the model’s proficiency.
