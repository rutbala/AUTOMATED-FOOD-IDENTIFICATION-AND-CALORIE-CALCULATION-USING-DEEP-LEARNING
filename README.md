# AUTOMATED-FOOD-IDENTIFICATION-AND-CALORIE-CALCULATION-USING-DEEP-LEARNING | Computer Vision, Deep Learning, Healthcare, Python 

Introduction:-

This project introduces an AI-driven solution for diet management using deep learning and computer vision techniques. We developed a system that employs Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to accurately identify food items from photos and estimate their calorie content using predictive analytics. Unlike traditional calorie tracking methods that rely on manual data entry and generic nutritional values, our approach automates the process with image recognition and machine learning algorithms, enhancing precision and user engagement. By training the CNN model on a diverse dataset using supervised learning, we ensure high accuracy in real-world scenarios. This tool simplifies dietary tracking, utilizing AI-powered automation to make it easier for users to monitor their intake and maintain a healthy lifestyle.

Modules:-

Convolutional Neural Network (CNN): A deep learning algorithm that processes images through layers of convolution and pooling, extracting features for accurate food classification and calorie estimation.

TensorFlow: The machine learning platform that powers the CNN, handling numerical computations and tensor processing for model training and deployment.

Keras: A high-level neural network library that simplifies CNN architecture design, data preprocessing, and model training, optimizing the AI for precise food recognition and calorie calculation.

Result:-

Our deep learning model demonstrates strong generalization and durability, achieving a test accuracy of 95.26% in classifying food images. This high accuracy reflects the modelâ€™s ability to learn and differentiate distinct food categories effectively. The loss value of 0.3423 indicates the model's confidence in its predictions, with lower loss suggesting more reliable classifications. Through multiple epochs, our CNN model consistently performed well in both training and validation phases, as illustrated in the "Training Accuracy" and "Validation Accuracy" graphs, underscoring its effectiveness in AI-driven food categorization and calorie estimation.
